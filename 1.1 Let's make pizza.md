Ingredients
For the base

1. 300g strong bread flour
2. tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)
3. 1 tsp salt
4. 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
5. For the tomato sauce
6. 100ml passata
7. handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried
8. 1 garlic clove, crushed
9. For the topping
10. 125g ball mozzarella, sliced
11. handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)
12. handful of cherry tomatoes, halved

The making 

1. Make the base in a large bowl, add salt, pour in 200ml warm water and oil.
2. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.
3. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like
4. Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste.
5. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
6. Roll out the dough.
7. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. 
8. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets. 
9. Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf.
10. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon.
11. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season.
12. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.
13. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using.
14. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
